# Alike: Use your social media activity to meet other like-minded people

# What is it?
Alike is a website powered by ASP.NET Core that brings people together based on their social media activity.

# How does it work?
To use Alike, you can connect one or more social media accounts to your Alike account. Once you've connected your account using OAuth 2.0 authorization, Alike will look at the content you've liked on your social media accounts. Alike will try to identify key words associated with the content and over time, it will determine what your interests are. It will show you a list of other users and groups that have similar interests to you. You then can connect with them so you can chat and share great conversations on the things you like!

# What social media accounts can you connect?
Currently, you can connect your Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Redit, and YouTube accounts. More may come later!

# Does give your data to other people?
# NO!
Alike will not store what content you've liked in its database, and it will not share the interests it determined from your liked content with other users unless you specify that you want other users to see one or more of your interests.
